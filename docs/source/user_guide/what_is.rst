What is |name|?
===============

**TO BE UPDATED...**

|name_bold| is a Vortex Lattice Method for linear aerodynamic modelling. VLM is widely used in preliminary aircraft design. |name| allows the user to model complex aircraft as a collections of lifting surfaces. Most notably, |name| features the following functionality.

* Data input from a native file format or from CPACS_
* Modelling of control surface deflections
* Modelling of airfoils
* Modelling of deformed wing shapes
* Estimations of aerodynamic loads and coefficients
* High automation
* Ability to be integrated in aeroelastic frameworks
