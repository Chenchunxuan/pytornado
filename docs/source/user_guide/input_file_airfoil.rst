Airfoil files
=============

Arbitrary airfoil geometries can be modelled in |name|. How airfoils files are referenced and used is described in :ref:`input_file_aircraft`. This page gives more notes on the actual airfoil file *format*.

Files found in the `UIUC Airfoil Coordinates Database <https://m-selig.ae.illinois.edu/ads/coord_database.html>`_ can be loaded. You can download a file from the UIUC database, place it in the *airfoils* folder and then reference it via ``airfoils/downloaded_airfoil_file.dat`` (see :ref:`input_file_aircraft`).
